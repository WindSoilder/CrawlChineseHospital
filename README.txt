This is a Chinese hospital query information program.
When you run command like this:
python queryHospital.py provinceName

If we don't given any provinceName, it will fetch your ip address, and try to figure where you are and return all third-grade class-A hospital in the province.
running with "all' argument will return all third-grade class-A hospital of all province.

The program will show us third-grade class-A hospital in one province.
And it's a demo project for using tornado Async programming.
